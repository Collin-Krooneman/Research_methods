# Week 5 reproducibility task 2

The provided shell script filters the word 'de' from any given text file. The text file needs to be invoked as a command line argument. This shell script looks at 'de' case-insensitive and case-sensitive. So the results are:
248 case-insensitive
216 case-sensitive

# usage 

To run the shell script you first need to grant permission with:
chmod +x Find_word_de.sh
You also need to put the provided text file in the same folder as the shell script.
The shell script used in the repository is run in Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows.
The text file can be found in the repository. https://github.com/Collin-Krooneman/Research_methods/blob/a42a7485be5278cadff2bb4f98f15c6ef2d0bf88/Universiteit.txt

Copy the content to a text file editor and save the text file in the same folder as the script. Then you can invoke the text file in the command line with the given name.
